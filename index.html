        <div class="left">Dr. Vikram Ambalal Sarabhai was an Indian physicist. He is the core astronomer who initiated the space program and helped develop nuclear power in India.
            <br><br>He was born on 12 August 1919 in Ahmedabad, Bombay Presidency, British India.

            He is one of the paramount Indian scientists who shaped the future of Indian space. He is famously known as the Father of the Indian Space Program. 
                
            <br><br>Both Homi Bhabha & Vikram Sarabhai completed their education at the University of Cambridge.
            Dr. Sarabhai recognized the essence of the Indian space program and made it big at that time.
            <br><br> Homi Bhabha & Vikram Sarabhai are the epic legacies that marked the phase of the science community in India. 

            Dr. Sarabhai inaugurated the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station, where the journey of India’s spaces began. He is also the leading founder of the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad. He also founded the Darpana Academy of Performing Arts along with his wife.

        <div class="right">Homi Jehangir Bhabha, entitled the Father of the Indian Nuclear Programme, was born on 30 October 1904 in Bombay Presidency, British India (present Mumbai, Maharashtra, India).
        <br><br> He is a preeminent Indian physicist who played an integral role in the scientific community of a newly independent India. Homi Bhabha was the founder-director and professor at the TIFR – Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. 

            Homi J. Bhabha is also the founding director of the AEET – Atomic Energy Establishment, Trombay, which is presently known as Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in his honor. 
            
            <br><br>Both TIFR and AEET were the stepping stone for the development of Indian weapons. He was a great scientist who signified the science field of India. 
            
            He completed his education at the University of Cambridge. He was an art connoisseur. The great Indian scientist Homi Bhabha received the Adams Prize in 1942 and Padma Bhushan in 1954. He was also nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for Physics in 1951 and 1953–1956. 
            
            In November 1954, Dr. Homi Bhabha presented his three-stage nuclear program that would rely on India’s abundant thorium deposits rather than Uranium.
